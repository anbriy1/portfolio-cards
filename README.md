Project Purpose (Goals)

The primary goal of portfolio-cards is to provide a lightweight, visually engaging portfolio template for developers who want to showcase their skills, projects, and contact info in a creative yet minimal way.

Key objectives include:

Delivering an interactive experience: a flip card animation that responds to user clicks.

Incorporating subtle audio feedback: a soft music effect that enhances the interaction.

Using modern design aesthetics: gradient backgrounds, smooth transitions, clear typography.

Keeping the architecture simple and accessible: built purely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no heavy dependencies.

Ensuring responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility, so it looks and works well on desktops, tablets, and phones.
